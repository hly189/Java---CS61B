Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  
  Why or why not?
  it is not stable bc if we have an odd numer of inputs, then as the very last step it could put an end item with equal value to a beginning item in front.

  Is quicksort stable?  
  Why or why not? 
  it is stable because it never rearranges numbers with the same value either into lesser, equal or greater queue
